# Acoustic_Modes_compare
This project was created during my time as a co-op at UMass Lowell's Structural Dynamics and Acoustics Lab. I built the below function in order to help analyze acoustic cavity test data. The function is specifically designed to analyze tests of wind turbine blades, but is modular enough to handle any type of acoustic data in the specified input format.
